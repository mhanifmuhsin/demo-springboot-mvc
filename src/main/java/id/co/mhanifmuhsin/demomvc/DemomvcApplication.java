/**
 * @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
 * @Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
 * @EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings,
 * other beans, and various property settings.
 * For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath,
 * this annotation flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors,
 * such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
 * @ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com/example package,
 * letting it find the controllers.
 *
 * The main() method uses Spring Boot’s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application.
 * Did you notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no web.xml file, either.
 * This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.
